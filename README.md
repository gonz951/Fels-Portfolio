![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/MIT-License-green)

## Description

This portfolio is not only a demonstration on using React to make a website, but also a portfolio to showcase my other skills. While the site itself is static, it's main purpose is to advertise myself as a valuable asset for future coding endeavours.

## Installation

With the use of 'npm i', 'npm run build', and 'npm run start', the project will be running smoothly. However, this portfolio is also available on Netlify:

## Usage

The first page is static, there's not much to do besides read. However, the navigation buttons will take you to other pages such as:

![The Portfolio page. It has two pictures that act as buttons to other websites](./images/Portfolio.png)

The portfolio page. It holds the projects that are fully completed with little to no errors and act as my portfolio pieces. The pictures on the page act as links to those projects.

![The Contact page. It has a form that requires a name, email, and message](./images/ContactMe.png)

The contact page. It has a simple form that accepts (requires) a name, email, and message in order to contact me.

![The Resume page. It has a downloadable link and a short list of my technical skills](./images/Resume.png)

The resume page. While my resume isn't visible, it's easily downloadable if one were to click the underlined 'download' text. It also has a short list of my technical skills if the resume isn't needed.
